Hello! I'm Brendon. I'm from Vietnam! If you're wondering what banhmipan even means, it just means "Bread bread" ("banh mi" is bread in Vietnamese and "pan" is bread in Japanese). 🍞
I love computers and are very fascinated about them. My dream college is MIT, and my dream job is a software engineer! 💻
I have a lot planned for life: I wish everyone success! 🍀
